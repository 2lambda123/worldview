**NOTE: This layer is undergoing beta testing.**

The Reflectance (Bands 5-4-3, Color Infrared) imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI is a false color, near infrared image composite. This band combination is useful for analyzing vegetation, where areas in red usually indicate better vegetation health. Dark areas are water, and urban areas are white. The Reflectance imagery layer is derived from a combination of the joint NASA/USGS Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data products through the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project.

The Reflectance imagery layer from Landsat 8 and 9/OLI product (L30) is available through the HLS project from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. The sensor resolution is 30 m, imagery resolution is 30 m, and the temporal resolution is daily with a 16 day revisit time. The imagery is available in Worldview/GIBS approximately 2 - 4 days after satellite overpass. There is a separate combined Sentinel 2A and Sentinel 2B imagery layer available.

This imagery layer is provided dynamically through the [NASA Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/impact). As it is dynamically generated, it may take slightly longer to display than normal. The imagery is also only available at higher zoom levels.
