Clean Infrared (10.3 Âµm, Band 13, ABI, GOES-West) Description
=======
The Clean Infrared (10.3 um, Band 13) layer from the GOES West Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is useful for detecting clouds all times of day and night and is quite useful in retrievals of cloud top height. It is used to identify and classify cloud and other atmospheric features, estimate cloud-top brightness temperature and cloud particle size, convective severe weather signatures, and hurricane intensity. This infrared window is not strongly affected by atmospheric water vapor.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-West satellite (currently, GOES-17) is centered on 137.2 degrees W, covering most of the Pacific Ocean, the USA, most of Canada, Central, the western half of South America, parts of Australasia. The GOES-West ABI imagery is available on a rollingmonthly basis at 10 minute intervals. The sensor resolution of Band 13 is 2 km, the imagery resolution in Worldview/Global Imaging Browse Services (GIBS) is 2 km and the temporal resolution is 10 minutes.
