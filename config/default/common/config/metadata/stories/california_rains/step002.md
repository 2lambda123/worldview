Tulare Lake in San Joaquin Valley, California, was once a large body of freshwater but water from tributaries were diverted for irrigation and municipal water use in the late 1800s. Subsequently, the dry lake bed was used to grow crops like almonds and tomatoes. The lake re-filled as a result of the heavy rains this past winter.
