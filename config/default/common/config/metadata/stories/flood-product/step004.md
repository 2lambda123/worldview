The best composite for a given flood event will depend on the available data (and its cloudiness) during the event, which can be evaluated directly in Worldview. In this example, the 3-day product on the right "B" side, shows lots of data gaps in an ephemeral lake, including a linear cutoff of its eastern portion, but the 2-day, on the left "A" side, shows a more realistic picture. The Terra and Aqua imagery provide an explanation: along with clouds, there is a swath gap impacting both Terra and Aqua at this location, for this date. Turn on and off the Aqua Corrected Reflectance layer to also see how the swath gap aligns with the sharp linear cutoff on the 3-day image.
