The Flood Product is generated for two compositing periods (2-Day and 3-Day), to help minimize the impact of clouds: surface obscuration and cloud-shadow false-positives as shadows often "look" like water to the algorithm. For each composite, if the total number of water detections from all Terra and Aqua observations exceed the required threshold (2, and 3 observations, respectively), the pixel is marked as surface water (cyan). If it also occurs where water is not expected, it is marked as flood (red). Grey pixels indicate insufficient clear data over the compositing period which is typically due to cloud cover.
