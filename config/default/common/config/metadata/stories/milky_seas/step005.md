We can investigate this a little further by adding the Sea Surface Temperature (L3, Night, Daily, Thermal, 4km) layer from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Aqua satellite, which has a similar overpass time as Suomi NPP. You can see that the western side of the milky sea stops at an area of cooler water shown in yellow which is giving it it's elongated shape.

(Worldview currently does not have a Suomi NPP/VIIRS Sea Surface Temperature layer for this time period)
