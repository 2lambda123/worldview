Let's make sure the milky seas aren't clouds. Shown here an opacity comparison of the Brightness Temperature (Band I5, Night) layer with the DNB layer. The DNB layer is on the "A" side and the brightness temperature layer is on the "B" side. The view currently shows the white milky sea in the center and darker purple clouds surrounding the milky sea. Swipe the button back and forth between A and B to see that the milky seas are not clouds and are unlike the surrounding cloud formations.
