The recently published study [Honing in on bioluminescent milky seas from space](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94823-z) has shown that DNB is a useful layer in pinpointing the location of milky seas and in the future, when more nighttime imagery is available it will be easier to spot these via satellite and research vessels can be tasked to go study the bioluminescent phenomena!
