When you are zoomed in enough on the map, a blue pointer icon will show next to your fire layer. This indicates that you can click on an individual fire point and retrieve information about that fire/thermal anomaly. Try clicking on an orange dot on the map to see the following information: Latitude, Longitude, Brightness Temperature (Channel 21/22) (for MODIS)/ (Channel I-4) (For VIIRS), Brightness Temperature (Channel 31) (For MODIS)/ (Channel I-5) (for VIIRS), Fire Radiative Power, Detection Confidence, Day/Night Flag, Along-Scan Pixel Size, Along-Track Pixel Size, Acquisition Date, Acquisition Time (in UTC), Satellite, Collection and Source. See detailed descriptions of the attributes for [VIIRS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/v1-vnp14imgt#ed-viirs-375m-attributes) and [MODIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/c6-mcd14dl#ed-firms-attributes) fire points.
