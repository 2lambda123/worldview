Twenty years later, the iceberg remained relatively close to the glacier. In the intervening years, the remaining iceberg, now named B-22A, still measured 71 km (44 miles) long and 45 km (28 miles) wide. B-22A moved only about 100 km from the calving site and it became grounded in a relatively shallow part of the Amundsen Sea.
