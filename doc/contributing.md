## Contributing

* Fork a version of Worldview
* Create a new branch that is in sync with the branch you would like to contribute to.
* It an issue does not already exist, file a new issue on GitHub related to the feature, bug, or improvement that you would like to work on

### Commits

* Make small commits that make your changes
* Commit messages should clearly portray what was worked on while referencing the issue it addresses

Example

```
One line commit header that references an issue #101

The paragraphs following the header are used to better describe what
is being done in the commit.
```
