        <p>
            This tool from NASA's
            <a href='http://earthdata.nasa.gov/about-eosdis' target='_blank'>EOSDIS</a> 
            provides the capability to interactively browse full-resolution, 
            global, near real-time satellite imagery from 50+ data products from
            <a href='http://lance.nasa.gov/' target='_blank'>LANCE</a>.  In  
            essence, this shows the entire Earth as it looks "right now" - or 
            at least as it has looked within the past few hours.  This  
            supports time-critical application areas such as wildfire 
            management, air quality measurements, and weather forecasting. The  
            data is generally available within three hours of observation and  
            can be compared to observations since May 2012 - just click or  
            drag the blue time sliders at the bottom of the screen to change  
            the currently-displayed date.  Arctic and Antarctic projections of  
            several products are also available for a "full globe" perspective.
            Browsing on tablet devices is currently supported (iPad 2+ 
            recommended) for mobile access. Please note, however, that this is
            an alpha (preview) release and many features are still under 
            development.
        </p>  
        <p> 
            Worldview uses the newly-developed
            <a href='http://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs' target='_blank'>Global Image Browse Services (GIBS)</a>  
            to rapidly retrieve its full-resolution imagery to provide an
            interactive browsing experience.  While Worldview uses
            <a href='http://openlayers.org/' target='_blank'>OpenLayers</a> 
            as its mapping library, GIBS also supports Google Earth, NASA 
            World Wind, and several other clients.  We encourage interested 
            developers to build their own clients or integrate NASA imagery 
            into their existing ones using these services.
